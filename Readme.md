# Get Me Some Soma 

## What is this?
This grabs all the current playlists from SomaFM and writes it into the $CWD. 

## Why?
I am forever moving machines, reinstalling machines, and [SomaFM](http://www.somafm.com) is the only online radio I tend to listen to. This makes it easier for me just run and load it into MPD for my listening pleasure.

## Syntax

    $ sh get_somafm.sh

## todo

* Populate new stations using http://somafm.com/channels.xml (curl, awk?)
