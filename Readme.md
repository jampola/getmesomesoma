# Get Me Some Soma 

Sorry, I couldn't think of a better title. This script grabs all of the [SomaFM](http://www.somafm.com) m3u's. This makes it easy for when I reinstall my machine and want my SomaFM m3u's in my MPD playlist folder.

Just run the script, and err... thats it!

Peath!

##ToDO

* Maybe add an option to choose between m3u's and pls's?
* Switch to toggle s/icy/http/
* Dunno?
